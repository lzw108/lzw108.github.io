I'm a Ph.D. candidate at [The University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/) and the [NaCTeM](https://nactem.ac.uk/) group. I'm advised by Prof. [Sophia Ananiadou](https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/sophia.ananiadou). My PhD journey started in July 2023. I obtained my M.Sc. degree in Computer Science from [The University of Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://english.ucas.ac.cn/), China.

<!-- I have been a visiting student at [the University of Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/) under the supervision of Prof. [Eduard Hovy](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~hovy/) since April.-->

<font color=Red>I am expected to graduate in Fall 2026 and am looking for full-time positions in AI, in either academia or industry. Please feel free to reach out if my background aligns with your needs.</font>


Research interests
======
My current research interests focus on Natural Language Processing and Large Language Models. Especially post-training, reinforcement learning, affective analysis, misinformation detection, and AI Safety. 

In case of interest in collaboration or joint work, please feel free to reach out via zhiweiliu0810@gmail.com.
