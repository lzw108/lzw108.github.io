I'm a first-year Ph.D. candidate at [The University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/) and the [NaCTeM](https://nactem.ac.uk/) group. I'm advised by Prof. [Sophia Ananiadou](https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/sophia.ananiadou). My PhD journey started in July 2023. I obtained my M.Sc. degree in Computer Science from [The University of Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://english.ucas.ac.cn/), China.

I have been a visiting student at the University of Melbourne under the supervision of Prof. [Eduard Hovy](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~hovy/) since April.


Research interests
======
My current research interests focus on Natural Language Processing and Large Language Models. Especially affective analysis(i.e. emotion detection and sentiment analysis), and misinformation detection (e.g. fake news, rumors, and conspiracy theories).

Professional services
======
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.
