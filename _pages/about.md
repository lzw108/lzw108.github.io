I'm a first-year Ph.D. candidate at [The University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/) and the [NaCTeM](https://nactem.ac.uk/) group. I'm advised by Prof. [Sophia Ananiadou](https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/sophia.ananiadou). My PhD journey started in July 2023. I obtained my M.Sc. degree in Computer Science from [The University of Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://english.ucas.ac.cn/), China.

I have been a visiting student at the University of Melbourne under the supervision of Prof. [Eduard Hovy](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~hovy/) since April.
