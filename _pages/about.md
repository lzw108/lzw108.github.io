I'm a Ph.D. candidate at [The University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/) and the [NaCTeM](https://nactem.ac.uk/) group. I'm advised by Prof. [Sophia Ananiadou](https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/sophia.ananiadou). My PhD journey started in July 2023. I obtained my M.Sc. degree in Computer Science from [The University of Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://english.ucas.ac.cn/), China.

<!-- I have been a visiting student at [the University of Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/) under the supervision of Prof. [Eduard Hovy](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~hovy/) since April.-->


Research interests
======
My current research interests focus on Natural Language Processing and Large Language Models. Especially affective analysis (i.e. emotion detection and sentiment analysis), and misinformation detection (e.g. fake news, rumors, and conspiracy theories).
