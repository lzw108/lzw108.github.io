I'm a Ph.D. candidate at [The University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/) and the [NaCTeM](https://nactem.ac.uk/) group. I'm advised by Prof. [Sophia Ananiadou](https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/sophia.ananiadou). My PhD journey started in July 2023. I obtained my M.Sc. degree in Computer Science from [The University of Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://english.ucas.ac.cn/), China.

<!-- I have been a visiting student at [the University of Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/) under the supervision of Prof. [Eduard Hovy](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~hovy/) since April.-->

<font color=Red>I am expected to graduate in Fall 2026 and am looking for full-time positions in AI, in either academia or industry. Please feel free to reach out if my background aligns with your needs.</font>


Research interests
======
My current research interests focus on Natural Language Processing and Large Language Models. Especially affective analysis (i.e. emotion detection and sentiment analysis), misinformation detection (e.g. fake news, rumors, and conspiracy theories), and AI Safety. 

In case of interest in collaboration or joint work, please feel free to reach out via zhiwei.liu@manchester.ac.uk.
